#  Dataset of 2D single-phase planar turbulent jet
## Dataset obtained by CFD simulation using ANSYS Fluent 21.2
## Please see "Flow reconstruction of single-phase planar jet from sparse temperature measurements" for details
## It is used by code under: '.\FPINN'
## It's a single case for PINN training and validation
## The data is dimensionless
